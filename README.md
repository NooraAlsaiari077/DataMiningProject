# DataMiningProject

Project Description

This project aims to apply data mining techniques to analyze the dataset “Game and Grade,” which represents the academic and gaming profiles of students. The dataset serves as a bridge between two domains: student demographics (particularly their grade level) and their video game consumption habits.



The central research question is:

What measurable correlation exists between students’ grade levels, their specific video game preferences, and their overall gaming engagement?



Objectives

The primary objective is to classify students based on the Grade column (pass vs. fail) using various classification algorithms and to assess their effectiveness in predicting academic outcomes. In addition, clustering techniques will be employed to group students who share similar academic and gaming behaviors. Correlation analysis will also be conducted to explore potential relationships between gaming frequency, parental education, family income, and academic performance.



Project Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to better understand the influence of gaming on students’ academic lives. For instance, certain types of games may be associated with higher or lower academic performance, while excessive gaming might disrupt students’ study habits and concentration. By identifying these relationships, the project aims to encourage healthier balances between studying and gaming, provide insights for parental involvement, and support strategies that can enhance academic performance, particularly for students at risk of failing.
